        <h1>Hamburger Steaks Recipe</h1>
        <p>Hamburger steaks are a simply-flavored patty mixture and the omission of tomato-based ingredients like tomato paste and ketchup, resulting in an unadulterated, beefier bite. It's easy and foolproof and completely worthy of your dinner table, especially considering it'll be ready in under an hour. Serve it over a bed of mashed potatoes, a healthy salad, or with Parker House rolls.</p>

        <h1>Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
            <p>A very quick and easy fix to a tasty side-dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many exotic and expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This recipe is cheap and tasty.</p>

        <h1>Hamburger Steaks Recipe</h1>
        <p>Hamburger steaks are a simply-flavored patty mixture and the omission of tomato-based ingredients like tomato paste and ketchup, resulting in an unadulterated, beefier bite. It's easy and foolproof and completely worthy of your dinner table, especially considering it'll be ready in under an hour. Serve it over a bed of mashed potatoes, a healthy salad, or with Parker House rolls.</p>
